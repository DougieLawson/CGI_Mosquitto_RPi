CGI_Mosquitto_RPi
=================

A Raspberry Pi sample using a CGI program to drive MQTT to send a message to a server to activate GPIO 

This is a sample of how to use the MQTT V3.1 protocol with python3 and FastCGI. 

It has been tested (but not exhaustively) with Mosquitto and RPi.GPIO on a model B (rev2) Raspberry Pi.
